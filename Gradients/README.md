# Grandients

These gradient swatches include the Material Palette as well as the gradient swatches for the finish and each long shadow.

Looking to have the swatches automatically added to your document? [Check my New Document Profiles](https://github.com/danielhickman/MaterialDesign/tree/master/New%20Document%20Profiles) Instead.

The long shadow gradients are the shade color of the object below from `20%` to `5%`. The finish is a radial white from `10%` to `0%` with a midpoint of `33%`.

Note: Illustrator doesn't all for swatches to move the starting points or angle of gradients.

### Windows Install:

To use one of these files, rename it to something you can remeber, then move it to one of these directory patterns:

**Presets:**

`C:\Program Files\Adobe Illustrator VERSION\Presets\LANG`

Replacing `USER` with your user, `VERSION` with AI's version number (CC 2014, CC 2015), `LANG` with your language and region (`en_US`), and `BIT` with either `x86` or `x64`.

**User Defined:**

`C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator VERSION Settings\LANG\BIT\Swatches`

Replacing `USER` with your user, `VERSION` with AI's version number (CC 2014 = 18, CC 2015 = 19), `LANG` with your language and region (`en_US`), and `BIT` with either `x86` or `x64`.


The directory for my computer looked like this:

`D:\Program Files\Adobe Illustrator CC 2015\Presets\en_US`

I use CC 2015 on the install drive of `D:/` and decided to make it a preset.

and this:

`C:\Users\Daniel\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator 19 Settings\en_US\x64\Swatches`

I use CC 2015 on the install drive of `D:/` and decided to make it a preset.
