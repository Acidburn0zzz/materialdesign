New Document Profiles are files that control the size, swatches, and some settings upon making a new document.
To use one of these files, rename it to something you can remeber, then move it to one of these dirs:

`C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator VERSION Settings\en_US\BIT\New Document Profiles`

Replacing `USER` with your user, `VERSION` with AI's version number (CC2014 = 18, CC2015 = 19), and `BIT` with either `x86` or `x64`


The directory for my computer looked like this:

`C:\Users\Daniel\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator 18 Settings\en_US\x64\New Document Profiles`
