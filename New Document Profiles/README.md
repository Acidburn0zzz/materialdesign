# New Document Profiles

New Document Profiles are files that control the size, swatches, and some settings upon making a new document.

These will add swatches, turn off pixel grid, and set the artboard to be 192x192 by default.

To use one of these files, rename it to something you can remeber, then move it to one of these dirs:

`C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator VERSION Settings\en_US\BIT\New Document Profiles`

Replacing `USER` with your user, `VERSION` with AI's version number (CC2014 = 18, CC2015 = 19), and `BIT` with either `x86` or `x64`


The directory for my computer looked like this:

`C:\Users\Daniel\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator 19 Settings\en_US\x64\New Document Profiles`

***

You can find the profile on the new document screen.
