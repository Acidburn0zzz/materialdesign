# New Document Profiles

New Document Profiles are files that control the size, swatches, and graphic styles, and some settings upon making a new document.

## Features:
* Adds the Material Design Color Palette
* Adds Graphic Styles for shadows (see [`MaterialDesign/Graphic Styles`](https://github.com/danielhickman/MaterialDesign/tree/master/Graphic%20Styles))
* Sets the artboard to 192x192 pixels
* Turn off `Align New Objects to Pixel Grid` by default

To use one of these files, rename it to something you can remember, then move it to a directory following the following pattern:

`C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator VERSION Settings\LANG\BIT\New Document Profiles`

Replacing `USER` with your user, `VERSION` with AI's version number (CC 2014 = 18, CC 2015 = 19), `LANG` with your language and region (`en_US`), and `BIT` with either `x86` or `x64`.


The directory for my computer looked like this:

`C:\Users\Daniel\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator 19 Settings\en_US\x64\New Document Profiles`

My name is Daniel, I use CC 2015 (19), on 64 bit in the US.

**You can find the profile on the new document screen.**
