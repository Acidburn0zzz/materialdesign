# New Document Profiles

New Document Profiles are files that control the size, swatches, and some settings upon making a new document.

These will add swatches, turn off pixel grid, and set the artboard to be 192x192 by default.

To use one of these files, rename it to something you can remeber, then move it to a directory following the following pattern:

`C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator VERSION Settings\LANG\BIT\New Document Profiles`

Replacing `USER` with your user, `VERSION` with AI's version number (CC 2014 = 18, CC 2015 = 19), `LANG` with your language and region (`en_US`), and `BIT` with either `x86` or `x64`.


The directory for my computer looked like this:

`C:\Users\Daniel\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator 19 Settings\en_US\x64\New Document Profiles`

My name is Daniel, I use CC 2015 (19), on 64 bit in the US.

**You can find the profile on the new document screen.**
