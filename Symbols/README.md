# Material Design Icons - Symbols for AI

## Install Symbols Library:
1. Download the .AI file of your choosing
2. Move the .AI file to a directory that you can find below
3. Navigate to `Symbols` > `Symbols Libraries Menu` > `Open Symbol Library` > `Other Library` and select the file if you put it in user symbols, restart Illustrator if you added it to the presets

### Find Your Directory:
**User Symbols:**

Navigate to `Symbols` > `Symbols Libraries Menu` > `Save Symbol Library...`

**Preset Symbols:**

Navigate to `Symbols` > `Symbols Libraries Menu` > `Open Symbol Library` > `Other Library...`

Copy this directory path to help you move the library and opening it in Illustrator.

### Directory Patterns:
**User Symbols:**

`C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator VERSION Settings\LANG\BIT\Symbols`

**Preset Symbols:**

`C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator CC YEAR\Presets\LANG\Symbols`

Replacing `USER` with your user, `VERSION` with AI's version number (CC 2014 = 18, CC 2015 = 19, CC 2016 = 20, CC 2017 = 21), `YEAR` is the CC year version, `LANG` with your language and region (`en_US`), and `BIT` with either `x86` or `x64`.


The directories for my computer looked like this:

`C:\Users\Daniel\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator 21 Settings\en_US\x64\Symbols`

`C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator CC 2017\Presets\en_US\Symbols`

My name is Daniel, I use CC 2017 (21), on 64 bit in the US.

## Create Updated File: 
Are the libraries not updated and you need more icons? The readmes in each libraries folders has instructions for creating them. You may also want to submit a pull request once you have the updated versions (hint hint).

## Files in this Folder:
* The ruby script is currently the method of updating Google's symbols

#### Legacy References:
* The AutoIt script used to work in conjunction with the Illustrator action to automate the creation of symbols before I figured out the SVG symbol tag
* The executable file is a build of the AutoIt script for ease of use
