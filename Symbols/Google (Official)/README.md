# Google's Material Design Icons- Symbols for AI

**Work in progress**

### Install Symbols Library:
1. Download the .AI file
2. Move the .AI file to a directory that follows the pattern below
3. Navigate to `Symbols` > `Symbols Libraries Menu` > `Other Library` and select the file

###### Pattern:
`C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator VERSION Settings\LANG\BIT\Symbols`

Replacing `USER` with your user, `VERSION` with AI's version number (CC 2014 = 18, CC 2015 = 19), `LANG` with your language and region (`en_US`), and `BIT` with either `x86` or `x64`.


The directory for my computer looked like this:

`C:\Users\Daniel\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator 19 Settings\en_US\x64\Symbols`

My name is Daniel, I use CC 2015 (19), on 64 bit in the US.
